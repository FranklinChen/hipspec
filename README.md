HipSpec - the Haskell Inductive Prover meets QuickSpec
======================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danr/hipspec.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danr/hipspec)

HipSpec is an inductive theorem prover for Haskell programs.  It will (try to)
conjecture essential lemmas to prove tricky properties.  It supports all
algebraic Haskell 98 data types and polymorphism.  We assume that functions
terminate on finite input and produce finite output.  All quantification is
only over total and finite values.

## Example

In the `examples/Rotate.hs` file we see the following definitions:

    rotate :: Nat -> [a] -> [a]
    rotate Z     xs     = xs
    rotate _     []     = []
    rotate (S n) (x:xs) = rotate n (xs ++ [x])

    prop_rotate :: [a] -> Prop [a]
    prop_rotate xs = rotate (length xs) xs =:= xs

The second definition defines a property in the HipSpec property language that
we would like to prove. The `=:=` operator simply means equals. Let's run HipSpec
on this file. We use `--auto` to automatically pick function to conjecture lemmas
from based on the properties in the program, and `--cg` to order equations in the
call graph of the program:

    $ hipspec Rotate.hs --auto --cg --verbosity=30
    Depth 1: 11 terms, 5 tests, 30 evaluations, 11 classes, 0 raw equations.
    Depth 2: 63 terms, 100 tests, 2164 evaluations, 48 classes, 15 raw equations.
    Depth 3: 1688 terms, 100 tests, 65050 evaluations, 1303 classes, 385 raw equations.
    Proved xs++[] == xs by induction on xs using AltErgo
    Proved (xs++ys)++zs == xs++(ys++zs) by induction on zs using AltErgo
    Proved length (xs++ys) == length (ys++xs) by induction on ys,xs using AltErgo
    Proved rotate m [] == [] by induction on m using AltErgo
    Proved rotate m (x:[]) == x:[] by induction on x using AltErgo
    Proved rotate (length xs) (xs++ys) == ys++xs by induction on ys using AltErgo
    Proved prop_rotate (rotate (length xs) xs == xs) by induction on xs using AltErgo
    Proved:
        xs++[] == xs
        (xs++ys)++zs == xs++(ys++zs)
        length (xs++ys) == length (ys++xs)
        rotate m [] == []
        rotate m (x:[]) == x:[]
        rotate (length xs) (xs++ys) == ys++xs
        prop_rotate (rotate (length xs) xs == xs)

The property and some lemmas conjectured by QuickSpec have been proved! Success!

## Installation instructions

HipSpec is only maintained for GHC 7.4.1 and GHC 7.6.3. Patches for other
versions are more than welcome.

You need to have the development version of QuickSpec. It can be obtained by
cloning that repository:

    git clone https://github.com/nick8325/quickspec

Assuming your directory structure looks like this:

    $CWD/
        hipspec/
            ...
        quickspec/
            ...

You current directory is $CWD. You can then install quickspec and hipspec in
one go, which makes the dependency analysis better:

    cabal install hipspec quickspec

### Supported theorem provers

Currently, we only support [Alt Ergo](http://alt-ergo.lri.fr/), in particular versions 0.94 and 0.95.
It exists in the
[ubuntu repositories](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/alt-ergo/0.94-1),
and in Arch Linux' [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/alt-ergo/).

## Tutorial

In HipSpec, QuickSpec will generate a background theory, which
then Hip will try to prove as much as possible from.
This little tutorial will try to explain how to use HipSpec
as a theory exploration system.

You need to import `HipSpec`. The data types you will put in the
signature needs to be an instance of `Eq`, `Ord`, `Data.Typeable`, and
`Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary`. Example:

    {-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}

    import HipSpec.Prelude

    data Nat = S Nat | Z
        deriving (Eq,Ord,Typeable)

    instance Arbitrary Nat where
        arbitrary = ...

Hipspec will look for a QuickSpec signature in a top level declaration called
`sig`.  The signature explains what variables and constants QuickSpec should
use when generating terms.

  * Make variables with `vars`, then string representations and
    something of the type of the variable.

  * Use `fun0`, `fun1`, `fun2`, and so on, and a string representation,
    for Haskell functions and constructors.

Example:

    sig = [ vars ["x", "y", "z"] (error "Nat type" :: Nat)
          , fun0 "Z" Z
          , fun1 "S" S
          , fun2 "+" (+)
          , fun2 "*" (*)
          ]

You need to give concrete, monoromorphic signatures to polymorphic functions
(and variables). QuickSpec gives you one which is called `A`. You can see it as
a skolem type. In fact, as you might have guessed, it's a newtype wrapper
around `Int`. To be able to translate from QuickSpec's internal representation
to HipSpec's, the string of functions and data constructors needs to match up
exactly as they are named in the source code.

Now, we are good to go!

    $ hipspec Nat

### Automatically Generated Signatures

HipSpec can generate a signature for you with the `--auto` flag. If you want to
see what signature it generated for you, use the `--print-auto-sig` flag.
Unfortunately, the monomorphiser is not very clever yet: say you have lists
in your program, then `(:)` will only get the type `A -> [A] -> [A]` and not
other presumably desireable instances such as `[A] -> [[A]] -> [[A]]` and
`Nat -> [Nat] -> [Nat]`.

### Theory Exploration mode

To make HipSpec print a small, pruned theory of everything that is proved
to be correct, run the compiled binary with `--explore-theory`, or `-e` for
short.

## Options and flags

Quick information about available flags can be accessed anytime by the
`--help` flag to the `hipspec` executable.

### QuickSpec flags

  * `--call-graph` (`--cg`): Order equations according to the call graph in the
    program.
  * `--swap-repr` (`-s`): Swap equations with their representative
  * `--prepend-pruned` (`-r`): Prepend nice, pruned, equations from QuickSpec
    before attacking all equations.
  * `--quadratic` (`-q`): Add all pairs of equations from every equivalence
    class instead of picking a representative.
  * `--interesting-cands` (`-i`): Consider properties that imply newly
    found theorems.
  * `--assoc-important` (`-a`): Consider associativity as most important
    and try to prove it first.

### Induction flags

  * `--inddepth=INT` (`-d`): Induction depth, default 1.
  * `--indvars=INT` (`-v`): Variables to do induction on simultaneously,
    default 2.
  * `--indhyps=INT` (`-H`): For some data types, and with many variables and
    depths, the number of hypotheses become very large. This flag
    gives the upper bound, and just cuts of if it gets too
    big (compromising completeness). Default is 200.
  * `--indobligs=INT` (`-O`): If the number of parts (bases and steps) gets
    over this threshold, this combination of variables and depths is
    skipped. Default is 25.

### Processors and parallel proving

While theorem provers are still usually single-core, you can run many 
of them in parallel. The `--processes` or `-N` flag will let you 
specify this. The default is 2, but if you to use eight cores: `-N=8`.

### Timeout

The default timeout is one second. It can be specified with the `-t` or
`--timeout` flag. With `-t=5`, each theorem prover invocation will be 5 seconds
long. The timeout can be issued as a double, so `-t=0.1` can be used to get
100 ms timeout.

### Output theories

Should you wish to inspect the generated theory, you can use `--output` (or
`-o`) and make a `proving/` directory. Then all relevant files will be put
there for you to view.
