  * Perform eta-expansion of properties.

  * Besides E-proof, Vampire also print which axioms were used to
    prove a lemma. This is not supported.

  * Run hipspec ghci-like. SPJ wrote down this list of functions:

        Linker.getHValue :: HscEnv -> Name -> IO HValue

        Look at TcSplice.runMeta

        Convert.thRdrName

        Behave like ghc –c, called “OneShot” mode.
