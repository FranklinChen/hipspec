TODO:

  * Either enforce a default branch or add infinite domain axioms.

  * Follow type predicates.

  * Add type predicates/guards for finite types

  * Perform eta-expansion of properties

  * Only add necessary data types to generated theories;
    don't only restrict to tuples of size two

  * Add function pointer axioms are to the theory

BUGs:

  * There seems to be some bug when the theorem provers report
    CounterSatisfiable. At one occasion I think a problem got
    registered as theorem when it actually was counter-satisfiable.
